# The ChipCode Programming Language

ChipCode is a compiled, bytecode interpreted strong functional programming language. The syntax was designed relatively close to C to provide a "C" style vibe to it and also a virtual machine for potability.

The whole point of this project is to not only create a functioning compiler but to teach how compilers work in the simplest way possible.
